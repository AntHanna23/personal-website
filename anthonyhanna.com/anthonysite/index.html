												<h4></h4>
												<p>During my internship at the Department of Homeland Security Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency, I created security automations with Ansible to ensure Linux systems stayed compliant with the standards requested by management. I also worked on vulnerability assesment and applied Splunk applications to forward logs on multiple operating systems for the DevOps and Technology team.</p>
